TITLE: Immerse Enrolment Module

DESCRIPTION: Web application for purchasing courses. Our task was to build a complex, multi-step form.

Features:

  - synchronization with Salesforce
  - integration with Zapier
  - a complex payment system, which includes the choice of a provider (Stripe or Flywire) depending on the type of product, as well as the implementation of split payments in Stripe
